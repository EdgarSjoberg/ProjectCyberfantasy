# ProjectCyberfantasy

Project Cyberfantasy is the combined efforts of @EdgarSjoberg and @AngeloDarwiche with the help of some friends to build a game that we can be happy with putting on our porfolios!

This site and the associated [Project]([url](https://github.com/users/EdgarSjoberg/projects/2)https://github.com/users/EdgarSjoberg/projects/2) will have updates on the process, as currently we are only in the early design phase.

# What can be revealed now though is a small teaser for the project:
A rogue lite in a cyber fantasy setting, with the core philosophy the weapons you choose shape your class.
